Like its predecessor, Above Human\" utilized a combination of web design, fashion, and visual art to create a comprehensive artistic experience that doubled as a social experiment.\n            </p>\n<p>Building on this foundation, Above Human consisted of a series of video releases, an original musical score, and a limited clothing line. It aimed to explore the complex and disturbing legacy of the Heaven's Gate cult while raising questions about the nature of belief, group dynamics, and the intersection of technology and spirituality. The project encouraged reflection on the power of clothing in group identity, the allure of fringe beliefs, and the thin line between devotion and delusion.</p>\n            <h2>Video Series</h2>\n            <p>\n              The first video showcased a close-up of Marshall Applewhite, the cult's leader, with his image pixelated and distorted. The second video depicted a crudely drawn Applewhite accompanied by an ominous voice clip and the year 1997. The third installment featured a sketch of a body wrapped in the purple blanket iconic to the cult's mass suicide. The fourth video showed a cartoon Applewhite pouring what appeared to be a toxin into applesauce, referencing the method used in the cult's mass suicide.All animations in the video series were hand-drawn by artist Abel, adding a unique and personal touch to the visual narrative.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The final video introduced models wearing recreated versions of the cult members' oversized crew neck sweaters, complete with the \"Away Team\" patch. This video also included scenes reminiscent of the tragic event, such as the purple blankets.\n            </p>\n           <h2>Music</h2>\n            <p>\n              The entire musical score for the project was produced by Lucas Broughton. The compositions notably incorporated samples from real seminars and speeches given by Marshall Applewhite, adding an authentic and chilling dimension to the project.\n            </p>\n                        <h2>Fashion Line</h2>\n            <p>\n              A limited clothing line was released as part of the project, consisting of 30 oversized crew neck sweaters, deliberately produced without small or medium sizes to ensure a baggy fit reminiscent of the cult members' attire. The sweaters featured a rainbow embroidered \"Above Human\" on the chest, a phrase frequently used by Applewhite.The iconic \"Away Team\" patch from the original cult uniform, was also available for separate purchase.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n             The clothing line gained popularity after being worn by internet personalities, though its limited release kept it scarce.</p>\n             <h2>Website</h2>\n            <p>\n              A key component of Above Human was the website goodartsucks.com.

       <p>\n             By wearing clothing emblazoned with \"Above Human,\" participants in the project temporarily adopted an identity that set them apart, mirroring the allure of exclusive group membership.</p>\n             <h3>Technology and Posthumanism:</h3>\n            <p>\n              In the context of the Heaven's Gate cult's beliefs about aliens and ascending to a \"Next Level,\" the phrase also touches on themes of technological advancement and posthumanist philosophy.</p>\n       <h3>Irony and Critique:</h3>\n            <p>The project's use of \"Above Human\" on consumer
